## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

This is a client-side only static website with no backend infrastructure required. The architecture follows a traditional web development approach:

- **Frontend**: Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks)
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with Google Fonts integration
- **Icons**: Font Awesome CDN
- **Deployment**: Static file hosting (can be deployed to any web server)

## Key Components

### 1. HTML Structure (index.html)
- Semantic HTML5 structure
- Navigation bar with smooth scrolling
- Hero section with call-to-action buttons
- Responsive meta tags for mobile optimization

### 3. Interactive Features (script.js)

## Data Flow

Since this is a static website, data flow is minimal and client-side only:

1. **User Interactions**: Click events, scroll events, and form submissions are handled locally
2. **Navigation**: Hash-based routing for single-page navigation
3. **Form Data**: Contact form data is captured but requires backend integration for processing
4. **Visual Feedback**: Real-time UI updates based on user actions (navbar changes, menu toggles)
